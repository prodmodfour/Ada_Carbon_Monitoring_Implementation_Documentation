# Carbon Intensity Forecast
We use the Carbon Intensity API to get a forecast of the carbon intensity of electricity in the UK. This is displayed as a line graph on the frontend.
# Estimated Usage Graph
We use Chart.js to create an interactive graph of estimated usage. This graph displays the estimated electricity usage and carbon footprint for a selected time period.
# Github Commit History Style Heatmap
We use a heatmap to display the estimated usage for each day in the past year. This heatmap is similar to the commit history graph on GitHub.
# Workspace Card
We display a card for each workspace that shows the estimated usage for that workspace. The card displays
# Machine Sizes
We display the machine sizes for each workspace. This is used to estimate the electricity usage and carbon footprint for each workspace.
# Carbon Equivalents
We display carbon equivalents for various activities to help users understand the impact of their compute usage. For example, we display the equivalent number of miles driven in a car or the number of trees planted.
