# What is this?

This github page documents the implementation of carbon monitoring in the Ada platform.

You can view the Ada website here: https://ada.stfc.ac.uk/ 

# What is carbon monitoring?
Carbon Monitoring refers to systems that:
1. Determine how much Co2 (or Co2 equivalent) was released by the platform that you are monitoring.
2. Collect that data over a time period.
3. Display that data to the user.

# What is the Ada Platform?
The Ada platform is a service available to members of STFC (https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/).
It allows users to create and use virtual machines that are powered by the R86 data centre at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. 

## Who uses the Ada platform? 
The platform is used by scientists. At the time of writing, the service is used by members of ISIS, CLF and Diamond.

## What are these virtual machines used for?
These virtual machines are used to:
* Run workloads that would be too computationally intensive for the user's usual workstation
* Access a specific set of software that has been preinstalled.

# What is STFC?
STFC stands for the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a UK government agency at the forefront of scientific and engineering research.
