# Key variables
The key variables in green computing are:
* Electricity Usage (kWh)
* Carbon Intensity (gCO2eq/kWh)
* Carbon Footprint (gCO2eq)
## Electricity Usage
Electricity usage is the amount of electricity consumed by a computing system. It is typically measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Reducing electricity usage can help to lower the carbon footprint of a computing system.
## Carbon Intensity
Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2eq) emitted per unit of
electricity consumed. It is typically measured in grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2eq/kWh). Carbon intensity can vary depending on the source of electricity generation. For example, electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind or solar has a lower carbon intensity than electricity generated from fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas.
## Carbon Footprint
Carbon footprint is the total amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2eq) emitted by a
computing system. It is typically calculated by multiplying the electricity usage (kWh) by the carbon intensity (gCO2eq/kWh). Reducing the carbon footprint of a computing system can help to mitigate climate change.


# Methods of reducing carbon footprint
## Time Shifting
Time shifting is the practice of scheduling compute-intensive tasks to run during periods of low carbon intensity. This can help to reduce the carbon footprint of a computing system by taking advantage of cleaner sources of electricity generation.
## Reducing Overprovisioning
Overprovisioning is the practice of allocating more resources than are actually needed for a computing task. This can lead to wasted electricity usage and a higher carbon footprint. Reducing overprovisioning can help to lower the carbon footprint of a computing system by ensuring that resources are used efficiently.
## Cutting down on idle usage
Idle usage is the practice of keeping computing resources powered on and ready to use, even when they are not actively being used. This can lead to wasted electricity usage and a higher carbon footprint. Cutting down on idle usage can help to lower the carbon footprint of a computing system by ensuring that resources are only powered on when they are needed.
